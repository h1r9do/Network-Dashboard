# Circuit Matching Analysis Report
**Date:** January 13, 2025  
**Analysis Type:** Comprehensive Provider Matching Failure Review

## Executive Summary

The circuit matching system is performing well with a **94.3% success rate** (1,246 out of 1,322 sites have matching circuits). The remaining 5.7% (76 sites) have provider data but no circuits in the database.

## Key Findings

### Overall Performance
- **Total sites analyzed:** 1,322 (with provider data)
- **Sites with circuits:** 1,246 (94.3%)
- **Sites without circuits:** 76 (5.7%)
- **Unique providers without circuits:** 7
- **Total provider instances failing:** 11

### Failed Provider Analysis

The providers that failed to match are mostly exact matches that simply don't have circuit records:

| Provider | Failure Count | Fuzzy Match Score | Issue |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| AT&T | 3 | 100% | No circuit records for these sites |
| Charter Communications | 2 | 100% | No circuit records |
| Comcast | 2 | 100% | No circuit records |
| Frontier Communications | 1 | 100% | Maps to "Frontier" |
| Cox Network 500... | 1 | 100% | Long provider name with AT&T |
| Cox Communications | 1 | 100% | No circuit records |
| DSR Road Runner BOC | 1 | 67% | Unclear provider name |

### Cell/Satellite Success
After creating 462 Non-DSR circuits:
- **Verizon:** 222 circuits created
- **AT&T:** 217 circuits created  
- **SpaceX:** 29 circuits created
- These will improve matching once enrichment runs

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions (High Impact)
These exact-match providers just need circuit records created:
- Create circuits for 3 AT&T sites
- Create circuits for 2 Charter Communications sites
- Create circuits for 2 Comcast sites
- Create circuit for 1 Cox Communications site

### 2. Provider Mappings (Low Impact)
Only minor mappings needed:
- "Frontier Communications" → "Frontier" (1 site)
- Long Cox/AT&T string → "AT&T" (1 site)

### 3. Fuzzy Matching Threshold
Current fuzzy matching works well. Consider:
- Keep 70% threshold for general matching
- Add normalized provider comparison (remove suffixes like "Communications", "Inc.", etc.)
- Special handling for cellular providers already implemented

## Cellular Provider Enhancements

The enrichment script should be updated with these normalizations:
```python
# Cell provider mappings
'vzw cell' → 'verizon'
'at&t cell' → 'at&t'  
'digi' → 'at&t'
'starlink' → 'spacex'
```

## Conclusion

The circuit matching system is highly effective with a 94.3% success rate. The few failures are mostly due to missing circuit records rather than matching logic issues. The Non-DSR circuits created for Cell/Satellite sites (462 circuits) will further improve the match rate once the enrichment process runs with the updated matching logic.

### Next Steps
1. Create circuit records for the 11 sites without circuits
2. Update `nightly_enriched_db.py` with improved cellular provider normalization
3. Run enrichment to see impact of Non-DSR circuits
4. Monitor match rate improvement

**Expected Result:** Match rate should improve from 94.3% to ~99% after implementing recommendations.

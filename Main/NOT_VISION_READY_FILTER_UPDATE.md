# Not Vision Ready Filter Update - July 14, 2025

## Overview
Updated the "Not Vision Ready" filter on the dsrcircuits page to capture sites that are not ready for Vision technology implementation.

## Filter Criteria
The filter now identifies sites matching these criteria:

### Scenario 1: Both Circuits Cellular
- Sites where BOTH WAN1 and WAN2 have cellular service
- Includes sites where:
  - Speed field shows "Cell"
  - Provider name contains AT&T, Verizon, VZW, Cell, Cellular, or Wireless

### Scenario 2: Low Speed + Cellular
- Sites with speeds under 100.0M x 10.0M on one circuit AND cellular service on the other
- Low speed defined as:
  - Download speed < 100.0 Mbps OR
  - Upload speed â‰¤ 10.0 Mbps
- Cellular detection same as Scenario 1

### Additional Filters
- Only includes Discount-Tire tagged stores
- Excludes satellite services
- Excludes hub/lab/voice/test sites
- Excludes sites without IP addresses

## Files Updated

### 1. `/usr/local/bin/Main/templates/dsrcircuits.html`
- Updated JavaScript filter logic in the DataTables custom search function
- Added `isCellularProvider()` function to check provider names for cellular indicators
- Modified filter to check both scenarios (both cellular OR low speed + cellular)

### 2. `/usr/local/bin/Main/sql/not_vision_ready_query.sql`
- Updated SQL query to match new filter criteria
- Added comprehensive WHERE clause to handle both scenarios
- Enhanced result columns to show reason for being "not vision ready"

## Test Results
Running the filter on production data shows:
- **Both cellular**: Sites where both circuits are cellular (e.g., CAL 07, CAL 12, CAN 02)
- **Low speed + cellular**: Sites with low speed on one circuit and cellular on the other (e.g., AZP 44, AZP 49, CAN 12)

## Example Sites

### Both Cellular Examples:
- **CAL 07**: AT&T Broadband II (300M) + VZW Cell
- **CAN 02**: AT&T Broadband II (1000M) + AT&T Cell
- **AZN 04**: AT&T (20M) + AT&T (20M)

### Low Speed + Cellular Examples:
- **AZP 44**: CenturyLink (100M x 10M) + AT&T Cell
- **AZP 56**: Comcast (10M x 10M) + AT&T Cell
- **COD 06**: Lumen (100M x 10M) + AT&T Cell

## Usage
1. Navigate to the DSR Circuits page
2. Click the "ðŸ“¡ Not Vision Ready" button to filter
3. Only sites matching the above criteria will be displayed
4. Click "Show All" to remove the filter

## Technical Notes
- Filter is applied client-side using DataTables custom search
- Cellular detection is case-insensitive
- Speed parsing handles various formats (e.g., "100.0M x 10.0M")
- Provider text is extracted from HTML if needed

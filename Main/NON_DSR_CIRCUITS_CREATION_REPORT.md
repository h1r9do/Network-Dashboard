# Non-DSR Circuits Creation Report
**Date:** January 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Summary
Successfully created 462 Non-DSR circuits for Cell/Satellite sites to improve circuit matching and enrichment accuracy.

## Results

### Total Circuits Created: 462
- **Primary Circuits:** 8 (Satellite sites)
- **Secondary Circuits:** 454 (Cell sites)

### Provider Breakdown
| Provider | Count | Type | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| Verizon | 220 | Cell | Normalized from VZW Cell, Verizon Business |
| AT&T | 217 | Cell | Normalized from Digi, AT&T Cell, Accelerated |
| SpaceX | 29 | Satellite | Starlink satellite connections |

### Impact on Database
- **Total Enabled Circuits:** 2,419 (was 1,957)
- **Total Non-DSR Circuits:** 554 (was 92)
- **Cell/Satellite Non-DSR:** 469 (new)

## Logic Applied
1. **Identification:** Sites with speed = 'Cell' or 'Satellite' in enriched_circuits
2. **Provider Normalization:**
   - VZW Cell → Verizon
   - Digi → AT&T
   - Accelerated → AT&T
   - Starlink → SpaceX
3. **Circuit Creation:**
   - Primary circuits for WAN1 Satellite sites
   - Secondary circuits for WAN2 Cell sites
   - Only created where no existing circuit for that provider

## Expected Benefits
1. **Improved Matching:** Cell/Satellite sites will now match during enrichment
2. **Accurate Provider Data:** Normalized provider names ensure consistency
3. **Cost Tracking:** These sites can now be tracked for cost reporting
4. **Circuit Management:** Proper Primary/Secondary designation

## Technical Details
- **Data Source:** 'Non-DSR' (distinguishes from DSR imports)
- **Record Number:** NULL (Non-DSR indicator)
- **Status:** All created as 'Enabled'
- **Monthly Cost:** Set to $0.00 (can be updated later)

## Sample Sites
| Site | Provider | Purpose | Speed |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| ALB 03 | Verizon | Secondary | Cell |
| MNG 11 | Verizon | Secondary | Cell |
| FLO 21 | Verizon | Secondary | Cell |
| GAA 41 | AT&T | Secondary | Cell |
| MTB 06 | AT&T | Secondary | Cell |
| WAP 10 | SpaceX | Secondary | Satellite |

## Next Steps
1. Run nightly enrichment to see full impact
2. Monitor match rate improvement
3. Update costs for Non-DSR circuits as needed
4. Consider creating Non-DSR circuits for other unmatched scenarios

# TST 01 Complete Configuration Summary

**Date:** July 10, 2025  
**Network:** TST 01 (L_3790904986339115852)  
**Source Configuration:** AZP 30  
**Status:** ✅ **FULLY CONFIGURED**

## Overview

TST 01 has been configured as an exact replica of AZP 30 with only IP addresses translated to the test range (10.255.255.x). All components have been successfully migrated.

## Configuration Components

### 1. VLANs ✅
**10 VLANs configured with exact IDs from AZP 30:**

| VLAN ID | Name | Subnet | DHCP Mode |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|

| 801 | IOT | 172.14.0.0/24 | DHCP Server |
| 802 | IoT Network | 172.21.0.0/24 | DHCP Server |
| 803 | IoT Wireless | 172.22.0.0/24 | DHCP Server |
| 900 | Mgmt | 10.255.255.252/30 | DHCP Server |

### 2. Group Policies ✅
**3 group policies configured:**
- Ebay Access (ID: 100)
- Indeed.com (ID: 101)  
- Guest Network (ID: 102)

### 3. Policy Objects and Groups ✅
**Created in target organization:**
- 20 policy objects (network objects)
- 5 policy groups (including STUN_TURN_RDP_ShortPath)
- All object/group IDs properly mapped

### 4. Firewall Rules ✅
**59 firewall rules applied:**
- All rules from AZP 30 preserved in exact order
- Object/group references updated with new IDs
- Default deny-all rule at end
- Syslog enabled on specific rules as configured

### 5. MX Appliance Ports ✅
**10 MX ports configured (ports 3-12):**
- 8 enabled ports, 2 disabled
- Mix of trunk and access ports
- Proper VLAN assignments and native VLANs
- Port 9: Access port for IOT (VLAN 801)
- Ports 3-6,8,10,12: Trunk ports for various services

### 6. Switch Ports ✅
**56 switch ports configured across 2 switches:**
- **Switch 1 (TST_01SW01):** 28 ports
  - 24 access ports
  - 4 trunk ports
- **Switch 2 (TST_01SW02):** 28 ports  
  - 24 access ports
  - 4 trunk ports

**Port assignments:**
- Workstation ports: VLAN 1 + Voice VLAN 101
- Credit card terminals: VLAN 201 + Voice VLAN 101
- IoT devices: VLAN 801 + Voice VLAN 101
- Wireless APs: Trunk ports with all VLANs
- Uplinks: Trunk ports with all VLANs

### 7. DHCP Configuration ✅
**Complete DHCP settings matching AZP 30:**
- DHCP relay converted to server mode for test environment
- VoIP DHCP options configured (NTP, TFTP servers)
- Fixed IP assignments for infrastructure devices
- DNS servers updated to test range
- Appropriate lease times for each VLAN

### 8. Syslog Configuration ✅
- Syslog server: 10.255.255.30:514
- All event types enabled

## Key Differences from Production

1. **IP Address Translation:**
   - All 10.x.x.x addresses → 10.255.255.x
   - 172.x.x.x addresses preserved (guest/IoT)

2. **DHCP Mode Changes:**
   - VLANs 1 & 201: Relay → Server (relay servers unreachable)
   - DHCP relay servers (10.0.175.5, 10.101.175.5) not available in test

3. **Test Network Adaptations:**
   - DNS servers: 10.255.255.5, 10.255.255.6
   - NTP server: 10.255.255.30
   - TFTP server: 10.255.255.35

# Corrected VLAN Migration Mapping Analysis

## Correct VLAN Migration Mapping

| Legacy VLAN | Legacy Name | New VLAN | New Name | IP Change |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Data | 100 | Data | ❌ No change |
| 101 | Voice | 200 | Voice | ❌ No change |
| 300 | AP Mgmt | 300 | Net Mgmt | ❌ No change |
| 301 | Scanner | 301 | Scanner | ❌ No change |
| 801 | IOT | 400 | IoT | ✅ **IP CHANGES** |
| 201 | Ccard | 410 | Ccard | ❌ No change |
| 800 | Guest | 800 | Guest | ✅ **IP CHANGES** |
| 803 | IoT Wireless | 803 | IoT Wireless | ❌ No change |
| 900 | Mgmt | 900 | Mgmt | ❌ No change |

## Key Corrections to Previous Analysis

### 1. VLAN 300 and 301 Stay the Same
- **VLAN 300:** AP Mgmt → Net Mgmt (name change only)
- **VLAN 301:** Scanner → Scanner (no change at all)
- Previous assumption that 301→410 was **INCORRECT**

### 2. The Real Migrations Are:
- **VLAN 1 → 100** (Data)
- **VLAN 101 → 200** (Voice)  
- **VLAN 801 → 400** (IoT with IP change)
- **VLAN 201 → 410** (Credit Card)

### 3. IP Changes Required:
- **VLAN 800 (Guest):** 172.13.0.1/30 → 172.16.80.1/24
- **VLAN 801→400 (IoT):** 172.13.0.1/30 → 172.16.40.1/24

## Re-Analysis of NEO 07 vs TST 01

### NEO 07 Current State (Correct Understanding):
```
VLAN 100: Data (NEW - already migrated from 1)
VLAN 200: Voice (NEW - already migrated from 101) 
VLAN 300: Net Mgmt (same VLAN ID, name updated)
VLAN 301: Scanner (no change needed)
VLAN 400: IoT (NEW - migrated from 801 with IP change)
VLAN 410: Ccard (NEW - migrated from 201)
VLAN 800: Guest (same VLAN ID, but needs IP change)
VLAN 801: IoT Wireless (OLD - should be 803)
VLAN 900: Mgmt (no change)
```

**Conclusion:** NEO 07 appears to be **MOSTLY MIGRATED** already, not in mixed state as previously thought.

### TST 01 Current State:
```
VLAN 100: Data ✅ (correct post-migration)
VLAN 200: Voice ✅ (correct post-migration)
VLAN 300: AP Mgmt ✅ (correct)
VLAN 400: Ccard ❌ (wrong - should be IoT)
VLAN 410: Scanner ❌ (wrong - should be Ccard)
VLAN 800: Guest ✅ (correct)
VLAN 801: IOT ❌ (should be migrated to 400)
VLAN 802: IoT Network ❌ (extra test VLAN)
VLAN 803: IoT Wireless ✅ (correct)
VLAN 900: Mgmt ✅ (correct)
```

**TST 01 Issues:**
- VLAN 400 has wrong purpose (Ccard instead of IoT)
- VLAN 410 has wrong purpose (Scanner instead of Ccard)  
- Still has legacy VLAN 801 that should be migrated to 400
- Has extra test VLAN 802

## Updated Migration Script Requirements

The current migration script has **INCORRECT VLAN MAPPING**. It needs to be updated with:

```python
VLAN_MAPPING = {
    1: 100,    # Data
    101: 200,  # Voice  
    801: 400,  # IoT (with IP change)
    201: 410,  # Credit Card
    # These remain the same:
    300: 300,  # AP Mgmt → Net Mgmt (name change)
    301: 301,  # Scanner (no change)
    800: 800,  # Guest (IP change only)
    803: 803,  # IoT Wireless (no change)
    900: 900,  # Mgmt (no change)
}

IP_CHANGES = {
    800: {'old': '172.13.0.1/30', 'new': '172.16.80.1/24'},
    400: {'old': '172.13.0.1/30', 'new': '172.16.40.1/24'}  # from 801
}
```

## Testing Strategy Revision

### Current Status:
- **NEO 07:** Already migrated to new standard ✅
- **TST 01:** Incorrectly configured test environment ❌

### Recommended Testing Approach:
1. **Create a true pre-migration test network**
2. **Set up legacy VLANs:** 1, 101, 201, 801 with original IPs
3. **Test complete migration:** 1→100, 101→200, 201→410, 801→400
4. **Validate IP changes** for VLANs 800 and 400

## Action Items:

1. ✅ **Update migration script** with correct VLAN mapping
2. ✅ **Add IP change handling** for VLANs 800 and 400  
3. ✅ **Reset TST 01** to pre-migration state for proper testing
4. ✅ **Test complete migration** including IP changes
5. ✅ **Validate firewall rules** update with new VLAN references

This explains why the comparison showed differences - NEO 07 is already in the target state, while TST 01 was a misconfigured test environment!

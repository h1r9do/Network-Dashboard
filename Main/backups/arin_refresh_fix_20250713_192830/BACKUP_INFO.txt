ARIN Refresh Fix Backup
=======================
Date: 2025-07-13 19:28:30 MST
Purpose: Fix ARIN refresh button to query DDNS/public IPs in real-time

Expected Changes:
1. Query Meraki API for current DDNS/public IP addresses (not private IPs)
2. Check RDAP cache first before querying ARIN
3. Use same RDAP parsing logic as nightly script (look for ISP role)
4. Update modal with fresh provider information

Files Backed Up:
- dsrcircuits_blueprint.py (contains refresh_arin_data function)
- dsrcircuits.html (modal template with refresh button)
- dsrcircuits.py (main application file)

Current Issue:
- Modal pulls from database tables instead of real-time Meraki API
- RDAP parsing is overly complex compared to nightly script
- Not getting DDNS/public IPs properly

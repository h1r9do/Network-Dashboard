print("=== Meraki Script Performance Comparison ===\n")

print("ORIGINAL SCRIPT (nightly_meraki_db.py):")
print("- Fixed delay: 0.2 seconds between device API calls")
print("- Fixed delay: 0.5 seconds for firewall rules")
print("- Fixed delay: 1.0 second in make_api_request (removed in our version)")
print("- Rate limit handling: Exponential backoff (2^attempt seconds)")
print("- Theoretical max speed: ~5 requests/second")
print("- Actual speed: ~3-4 requests/second due to network latency")
print("- For 1,300 devices: ~5-7 minutes minimum")

print("\nADAPTIVE SCRIPT (nightly_meraki_db_adaptive.py):")
print("- Dynamic delay: 0.05 to 2.0 seconds (adaptive)")
print("- Starts at: 0.5 seconds (2 req/sec)")
print("- Can speed up to: 0.05 seconds (20 req/sec)")
print("- Speeds up after: 50 consecutive successes")
print("- Backs off by: 50% on rate limit")
print("- Speeds up by: 10% when successful")
print("- Cooldown: 10 seconds between speed changes")

print("\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR:")
print("1. Start conservatively at 2 req/sec")
print("2. After 50 successful calls (~25 seconds), speed up to 2.2 req/sec")
print("3. Continue speeding up every 50 calls if no rate limits")
print("4. If rate limit hit, immediately slow down by 50%")
print("5. Find optimal speed for current API conditions")
print("6. Could potentially reach 10-15 req/sec in good conditions")

print("\nPERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:")
print("- Best case: 4-5x faster (from 5 req/sec to 20 req/sec)")
print("- Typical case: 2-3x faster (reaching 10-15 req/sec)")
print("- Worst case: Same speed as original if heavily rate limited")
print("- For 1,300 devices: Could complete in 2-3 minutes instead of 5-7")

print("\nTO DEPLOY:")
print("1. Test the adaptive version:")
print("   sudo python3 /usr/local/bin/Main/nightly_meraki_db_adaptive.py")
print("\n2. Watch the logs to see adaptive behavior:")
print("   sudo tail -f /var/log/meraki-mx-db.log")
print("\n3. If successful, replace the production script:")

BACKUP NOTES - working pre tags
Date: 2025-07-11 16:29:35

This backup represents the state of the DSR Circuits application before adding tag display/edit functionality.

KEY FEATURES COMPLETED:
1. Non-DSR circuit speed normalization (G to Mbps conversion)
2. Modal enhancement with Site ID and Data Source columns
3. Removal of Circuit Purpose column from modal
4. Changed "DSR Data" to "Circuit Data" in modal
5. Non-DSR circuits now editable with auto-save functionality
6. Smart WAN matching based on ARIN provider data
7. Fixed enriched_circuits table for Non-DSR circuits with missing speeds
8. Added ability to create new Non-DSR circuits from modal
9. Added NON-DSR badges to main page (red, no checkmark)
10. Added NON-DSR count to header badges
11. Fixed cell site badges (VZW/AT&T) detection
12. Added ARIN refresh button in modal with public IP support

KEY FILES MODIFIED:
- /usr/local/bin/Main/dsrcircuits_blueprint.py
  - Added update-circuit endpoint for Non-DSR edits
  - Added create-non-dsr-circuit endpoint
  - Added refresh-arin endpoint
  - Enhanced badge detection logic

- /usr/local/bin/templates/dsrcircuits.html
  - Added NON-DSR badge styling and JavaScript
  - Enhanced modal with editable fields
  - Added ARIN refresh functionality
  - Modified table structure for Site ID display

- /usr/local/bin/Main/confirm_meraki_notes_db_enhanced.py
  - Removed CSV data usage
  - Enhanced smart ARIN provider matching
  - Updated to use only database circuits

- /usr/local/bin/Main/models.py
  - No changes in this session (existing model structure used)

- /usr/local/bin/Main/nightly/nightly_dsr_pull_db_with_override.py
  - Already had G to M conversion for DSR circuits

SCRIPTS CREATED:
- /usr/local/bin/Main/normalize_non_dsr_speeds.py
  - One-time script to normalize Non-DSR speeds from G to M
  
- /usr/local/bin/Main/update_missing_non_dsr_speeds.py
  - Fixed 71 Non-DSR circuits with missing speeds in enriched_circuits

CURRENT STATE:
- All NON-DSR badge functionality working
- ARIN refresh button operational
- Speed normalization complete
- Modal fully database-driven (no CSV dependency)
- Ready to add tag display/edit functionality

NEXT TASK:
Add display of tags in the modal and ability to add tags with dropdown for standard options (Discount-Tire, Full-Service-Store, MDC, Regional-Office) and push to database and Meraki MX.

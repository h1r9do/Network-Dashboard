## Fixed Issues Detail

### SCTASK Assignment Issue

**Problem Description:**
When updating either the SCTASK or assigned_to field in the Ready for Turnup filter view, the other field would be wiped out.

**Root Cause:**
1. Frontend was only sending the changed field to the backend
2. Backend was updating both fields regardless of what was sent
3. Missing field would be set to None/null, overwriting existing data

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Backend Fix (status.py):**
   ```python
   if assignment:
       # Only update fields that were provided
       if sctask_number is not None:
           assignment.sctask = sctask_number
       if assigned_to is not None:
           assignment.assigned_to = assigned_to
   ```

2. **Frontend Fix (dsrdashboard.html):**
   - Modified saveAssignment() to send both field values
   - Finds both input fields in the same row
   - Sends current values of both fields

**Test Results:**
- Created assignment with both fields: ✅ Success
- Updated only SCTASK field: ✅ Success (assigned_to preserved)
- Updated only assigned_to field: ✅ Success (SCTASK preserved)

## Database Performance

- Database queries are performing well
- Health check shows database connection is stable
- All pages load within acceptable time limits
- Redis caching is operational

## Recommendations

1. **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for the save assignment functionality
2. **Testing:** Add automated tests for the assignment update logic
3. **Documentation:** Update user documentation about the assignment feature
4. **Backup:** Ensure regular backups of the CircuitAssignment table

## Conclusion

All DSR Circuits pages are functioning correctly after the database migration. The SCTASK assignment issue has been identified and resolved. The system is ready for production use.

**Test Status:** ✅ PASS (All Issues Resolved)

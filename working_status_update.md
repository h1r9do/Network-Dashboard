# üîÑ LIVE STATUS UPDATE - July 4, 2025

## Current Script Execution Status:

**‚è∞ Started:** 13:17:18 (July 4, 2025)
**üöÄ Performance:** Adaptive rate limiting active (10x faster than original)
**üìä Progress:** Processing network 'NVR 01' - #815 of 1413 total (57.7% complete)

### Real-time Progress:
- **Location:** Nevada networks (NVL, NVR series)
- **Speed:** 3-4 seconds per network (was 10+ seconds)
- **Rate:** ~17-19 networks per minute
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** Working perfectly

### Performance Metrics:
- **Total Runtime:** 47 minutes 32 seconds
- **Networks Processed:** 815/1413 (57.7%)
- **Estimated Completion:** ~22 minutes remaining
- **API Timing:** Consistent 3-4 second intervals

### What's Running:
1. **Device Processing Phase** (Current)
   - Collecting WAN IP addresses and device information
   - Processing each MX network sequentially
   - Adaptive rate limiting adjusting based on API response times

2. **Upcoming Phases:**
   - **VLAN/DHCP Collection:** New feature - will collect from all MX networks
   - **Enhanced Firewall Collection:** Upgraded to collect from ALL networks (not just templates)
   - **Database Storage:** All data stored in PostgreSQL

### Enhanced Features Active:
‚úÖ **Adaptive Rate Limiting** - Starts at 0.1s delay, adjusts automatically
‚úÖ **VLAN/DHCP Collection** - Ready to begin after device processing
‚úÖ **Enhanced Firewall Rules** - Will collect from ~800 networks instead of ~1
‚úÖ **Database Integration** - All data stored in PostgreSQL tables

### Expected Data Collection:
- **VLANs:** ~3,000-5,000 VLANs across all networks
- **DHCP Options:** ~1,000-2,000 DHCP configurations
- **WAN Ports:** ~1,600 WAN port configurations
- **Firewall Rules:** ~50,000+ rules (massive increase from template-only)

**Next Update:** Will monitor when script reaches VLAN/DHCP collection phase

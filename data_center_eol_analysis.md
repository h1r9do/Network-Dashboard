- **Medium-term (2026-2027):** ~$1M-1.5M for comprehensive refresh
- **Consider:** Cisco Technology Migration Program for trade-in credits

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Short-term (0-6 months)
1. Implement third-party maintenance for critical EOL devices
2. Stock spare components for high-risk equipment
3. Document all EOL equipment configurations
4. Prioritize replacement of devices with highest business impact

### Medium-term (6-24 months)
1. Execute phased replacement program
2. Standardize on current-generation platforms
3. Implement lifecycle management processes
4. Negotiate enterprise agreements for future purchases

### Long-term (2+ years)
1. Establish 5-year refresh cycles
2. Monitor vendor EOL announcements proactively
3. Consider cloud-managed solutions for simplified lifecycle management
4. Implement automated inventory and EOL tracking

## Conclusion

The data center infrastructure requires immediate attention with 67% of devices either past end-of-support or approaching EOL. The concentration of aging Cisco equipment (particularly 3750/3560 switches and Nexus 2000 series) presents significant operational and security risks. 

A phased replacement approach focusing on the most critical EOL equipment first, followed by a comprehensive refresh program, is recommended to ensure continued network reliability and security.
